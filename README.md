# SQL--Challenge

# Background

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. 

We will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database (Postgres), and answer questions about the data. The two major tasks are:

1) Data Engineering / Data Modeling

2) Data Analysis

Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. We use the Quick Database Diagrams.
